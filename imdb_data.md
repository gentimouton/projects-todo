# Analyses
* Are guest actors in British murder mystery TV shows (Poirot, Midsommer, Father Brown) always the same?
* Predict when actors "break through"
* Long-standing (directors, actors) pairs
* Smallworlds, 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon
* Top actors and directors by rating across movies
* Person ratings increase/decrease as person gets older? Artist lifetime. 
* Porn: how many performers convert from "adult-only" to "not adult" movies? e.g. Sunny Leone
* Genres appearing over time, and their ratings. e.g. Westerns in the 60s, fantasy in the 2000s, scifi in the 80s
