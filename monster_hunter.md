Shadow of the Colossus/Monster Hunter in 2D
===

- Get a bounty for a monster, kill that monster, receive bounty reward, improve gear, get higher bounty, repeat.
- Each monster has a particular behavior, eg a crab moves sideways and can only be attacked from behind.
- Top-down graphics like old Zelda. Maybe the code from crowd-control could work for that.
