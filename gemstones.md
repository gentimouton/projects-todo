Craft jewelry from precious stones, then sell them.

- collection, gacha, crafting game
- similar games: recettear, hay day, pokemon, disco zoo, stardew
- rarities: implicit (pokemon) or explicit (star system, color code)? 
- modes: haggle prices on market, collect gems in mine, deliver jewelry in town, repair jewelry in shop
- combo sets/recipes
- refine: combine 3 gems of a kind to upgrade, a la D3. Call it purity or carats.
- can encourage player to refine by only providing gems level 1 and 4, or giving $ for upgraded gems socketed.
- gameplay loops: what's the player doing every 10s, 2m, 1h.
- ticking time of day, like in stardew and recettear?
- make jewelry for customers' orders - they provide blueprints
- fix ancient jewelry for museum
- sell jewelry in auctions to the high society
- pay thieves to steal blueprints from other shops
- blueprints: discovery via trial and error is not fun? allow freeform jewelry creation? how do you "grade" it?
- each staff has different skills - gold worker, salesman, organic gems cutter, etc.
- craft the same recipe N times in a row, get N% bonus (make grinding fun?) - or craft N>3 at once and receive N^2/10 more?
- mats: can salvage from existing jewelry, buy unrefined from miners, haggle from other jewelers
- haggling engine: buyer has a max, mini-game is finding out where it is without passing it? Only allowed 3 tries (Recettear)?
