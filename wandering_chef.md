Wandering chef idle game
===

Traveling salesman, but with a food truck.
Inspired by [Tiny Rails](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-rails/id1159072426?mt=8).

Dishes cooked depend on ingredients in truck, and patrons' orders.
* Fish and Chips = Fish + Potatoes (frier is included in truck).
* Hamburger = Bun + Meat patty + Lettuce 

Ingredients available in a city change every once in a while. 
But certain ingredients can only be found in certain cities.
* Potatoes: found everywhere.
* Atlantic Cod: East-Coast cities.
* Beignet dough: New Orleans.

The truck can carry a certain amount of ingredients. 
Some truck upgrades increase storage.

When AFK, the food truck's chef cooks food for people in a city. And makes money, but slowly.

Best money is made when traveling to other cities and making dishes in high demand, not idle-playing. 
Plus, stocks run out eventually.
